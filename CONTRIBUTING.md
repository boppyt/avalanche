# How to contribute

Note: contributing implies licensing those contributions
under the terms of [LICENSE](LICENSE.md), which is an ISC license.

## Opening issues

* Make sure there is no open issue on the topic
* Make sure to provide a minimal reproducible configuration (if related)
* [Submit a new issue](https://github.com/boppyt/avalanche/issues/new)

## Submitting changes

* Format the commit messages in the following way:

  ```
  (topic, e.g chore, project, etc): (from -> to | fix (issue) | refactor | etc)

  (Motivation for change. Additional information.)
  ```

  For consistency, there should not be a period at the end of the commit message's summary line (the first line of the commit message).

  Examples:

  * colors: make graphite brighter
  * project: fix typo in readme

## Writing good commit messages

In addition to writing properly formatted commit messages,
it's important to include relevant information so other developers can later understand *why* a change was made.
While this information usually can be found by digging code, mailing list/Discourse archives, todo discussions or upstream changes,
it may require a lot of work.

For color changes and such a one-line commit message is usually sufficient.
